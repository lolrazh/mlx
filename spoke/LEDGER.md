# Spoke Experiment Ledger

> Single source of truth for every training run, benchmark, and planned experiment.

## How to Read This

- **Clean accuracy** = generic or v2 prompt only (no few-shot, no data leakage). The only honest metric.
- **Spoke accuracy** is crossed out where shown — 4/23 test examples leaked into the few-shot prompt. See [Data Leakage](#data-leakage) below.
- **Data v1** = 472 train, generic v1 system prompt (~30 tokens), includes multi-command category.
- **Data v2** = 447 train / 20 valid / 23 test, v2 system prompt (~80 tokens), multi-command removed, targeted self-correction + quote-endquote fixes, XML tag fixes.
- **Accuracy** = (exact + semantic) / N. Test set: 12 examples (v1) or 23 examples (v2).
- **6-bit is the deploy quant.** bf16/8-bit = same accuracy. 4-bit drops ~17% (2 examples). See [Quant Impact](#quantization-impact).
- Benchmark results as JSON: `spoke/bench/result_*.json`

## Baselines (Zero-Shot, No Training)

### v1 test set (12 examples)

| ID | Model | Quant | Prompt | N | Accuracy | Latency | Notes |
|----|-------|-------|--------|---|----------|---------|-------|
| B1 | Qwen3-4B | 4-bit | generic v1 | 12 | **25%** | 0.69s | Real floor. Model barely understands the task. |
| B2 | Qwen3-4B | 4-bit | v2 | 12 | **50%** | 0.91s | Prompt alone doubles accuracy. Best clean baseline on v1. |
| B3 | Qwen3-4B | 4-bit | task-specific | 12 | **50%** | 0.89s | Per-category prompts = same as v2. |
| B4 | Qwen3-4B | bf16 | v2 | 11 | **36%** | 1.64s | bf16 more verbose at zero-shot. Interim test set (11 ex). |
| B5 | Llama 1B | bf16 | generic v1 | 12 | **8%** | 2.00s | Hallucinations, refusals, code generation. |
| B6 | Llama 1B | bf16 | task-specific | 12 | **25%** | 1.12s | Marginal improvement over generic. |
| ~~B7~~ | ~~Qwen3-4B~~ | ~~4-bit~~ | ~~spoke~~ | ~~12~~ | ~~58%~~ → 38% | ~~1.43s~~ | ~~LEAKED. 4/23 test examples in few-shot prompt.~~ |
| ~~B8~~ | ~~Llama 1B~~ | ~~bf16~~ | ~~spoke~~ | ~~12~~ | ~~25%~~ | ~~0.76s~~ | ~~LEAKED. Same score either way.~~ |

### v2 test set (23 examples)

| ID | Model | Quant | Prompt | N | Accuracy | Latency | Notes |
|----|-------|-------|--------|---|----------|---------|-------|
| B9 | Qwen3-4B | 4-bit | generic v1 | 23 | **13%** | 0.68s | Real floor on v2 test set. Only caps + emoji pass. |
| B10 | Qwen3-4B | 4-bit | v2 | 23 | **35%** | 0.85s | v2 baseline. 7 exact + 1 semantic. |

**Takeaway:** V2 test set is significantly harder — generic floor drops from 25% to 13%, v2 prompt from 50% to 35%. T4's 74% bf16 = **+61 points** over floor, **+39 points** over v2 baseline.

## Training Runs

All runs use Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507-bf16 unless noted. All use `mask_prompt: true`, `batch_size: 4`, `lr: 1e-5`, `num_layers: 16`, `seed: 42`.

## Fine-Tuned Benchmarks (Clean Results Only)

All from Qwen3-4B base.

> **Test set change at T4:** T1-T3 used v1 test set (12 examples, basic categories). T4+ uses v2 test set (23 examples, adds XML multi-step, complex email, hard negatives, more quote/correction variants). **Accuracy percentages are NOT comparable across the boundary.** Compare T1-T3 against each other, and T4+ against each other.

### T1-T3: v1 test set (12 examples), v1 training data (472 train, 8 valid)

### T4+: v2 test set (23 examples), v2 training data (447 train, 20 valid)

| Run | Checkpoint | Quant | Prompt | N | Accuracy | Exact | Sem | Part | Fail | Latency | Notes |
|-----|-----------|-------|--------|---|----------|-------|-----|------|------|---------|-------|
| T2 | iter 400 | 6-bit | generic v1 | 23 | **65%** | 14 | 1 | 8 | 0 | 0.82s | Old best on new test set. Nails basics, fails XML/compound. |

## Quantization Impact

From T2 (r=8, iter 400). Same adapters, different quant levels.

| Quant | Size | Generic Acc | Latency | Delta vs 6-bit |
|-------|------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| bf16 | 7.5 GB | 75% | 1.75s | = |
| 8-bit | 4.0 GB | 75%* | 0.79s | = |
| **6-bit** | **3.1 GB** | **75%** | **0.79s** | **reference** |
| 4-bit | 2.1 GB | 58% | 0.81s | -17% (2 examples) |

*8-bit was measured during thermal throttle; re-measured matches 6-bit.

**Verdict:** 6-bit is the deployment target. 4-bit loses too much.

## Persistent Failures (v1 data)

These 2 examples fail across ALL training configs (T1, T2, T3) and all quant levels.

| Test | Category | Input | Expected | Model Output | Root Cause |
|------|----------|-------|----------|-------------|-----------|
| #3 | self-correction | "...Cloudflare Workers and Groq. Wait no, sorry, Fireworks." | "...Cloudflare Workers and Fireworks." | "...Fireworks." | Drops compound phrase. Training teaches "replace whole clause", but needs partial replacement. |
| #6 | quote-endquote | "...quote lucky to be here. end quote..." | "...\"lucky to be here\"..." | "...\"lucky\" to be here." | Wraps 1 word instead of phrase. Only 12 quote-endquote training examples (2.4% of data). |

**T4 (v2 data) adds targeted examples for both patterns.** This is the primary expected improvement.

---

## Data Leakage

Discovered 2026-03-01. Four test examples are exact copies of few-shot examples in `spoke/bench/prompts.py`:

| Test ID | Category | Status |
|---------|----------|--------|
| #1 | spell-replace | Leaked |
| #7 | quote-unquote | Leaked |
| #14 | emphasis | Leaked |
| #20 | camelcase | Leaked |

**Impact (v1 test set, 12 examples):** Spoke-prompt baselines were inflated ~20%. The "58% spoke baseline" was actually 38% on clean examples. The "83% fine-tuned spoke" was 75% clean. Leakage still present in v2 test set (4/23 = 17%). Clean results use generic or v2 prompts only — not affected by this leakage.

## Experiment Queue

| Priority | Run | What Changes | Hypothesis | Depends On |
|----------|-----|-------------|-----------|------------|
| ~~DONE~~ | ~~T4~~ | ~~v2 data (targeted examples + v2 prompt)~~ | ~~Fixes #3 and #6, breaks 75% ceiling~~ | ~~74% bf16, 65% 6-bit. #3 FIXED, #6 scope FIXED.~~ |
| HIGH | T5 | DoRA (fine_tune_type: dora) | Better weight decomposition at r=8 → ≥ T4 | T4 result |
| HIGH | T6 | AdamW (weight_decay: 0.01) | Prevents weight drift → more stable training | T4 result |
| HIGH | T7 | Cosine LR + warmup (50 steps) | Avoids early instability → lower val loss | T4 result |
| HIGH | T8 | DoRA + AdamW + cosine (full stack) | Combined gains → best overall | T5-T7 individual signals |
| Medium | T9 | QLoRA (4-bit base model) | Same quality, 9GB → ~4-5GB memory | T4 result |
| Medium | T10 | mask_prompt: false | More gradient signal for short outputs (~15 tok) | T4 result |
| Low | Expand to 650-750 examples | Target optimal data volume per research | After T4-T8 |
| Low | NEFTune (noise embeddings) | Anti-overfitting regularization | Only if still overfitting |
| Low | DPO on persistent failures | Preference learning for edge cases | Only after SFT plateau |

## Key Findings

1. **r=8 = r=16** for this formatting task. Half the params (7.3M → 3.7M), same accuracy, later overfitting onset.
2. **6-bit is deploy quant.** 4-bit loses 2 examples. bf16/8-bit = 6-bit quality but 2-4x larger.
3. **V2 prompt doubles zero-shot** accuracy (25% → 50% on v1 test, 13% → 35% on v2 test).
4. **Fine-tuning gain is +61 points** on v2 test set (13% → 74% bf16). Biggest single improvement.
5. **V2 test set is harder** — floor drops from 25% → 13%, v2 prompt from 50% → 35%. Accuracy NOT comparable across test set versions.
6. **Training/inference prompt mismatch costs 13%** (74% → 61% on v2 test). Always match.
7. **83% was actually 75%** after correcting for data leakage. All spoke benchmarks are contaminated.
8. **V2 data fixed persistent failures** — self-correction #3 (compound phrase) and quote-endquote #6 (multi-word scope) both improved with targeted training examples.
9. **6-bit quant regression worse on T4** — lost 9% (74% → 65%) vs T2's zero loss. Edge cases (quote-endquote, code-aware) are quant-sensitive.
10. **Llama 1B not viable.** 25% accuracy gap vs Qwen. Overfits 2.5x faster.
11. **Overfitting timeline:** r=8 starts ~iter 350 on v2 data, ~iter 500 on v1 data. Llama 1B starts ~iter 200.
12. **MLX-LM has unused features:** DoRA, AdamW, cosine decay, gradient checkpointing, LoRA key targeting — all built in.
